# Playing with Astro

This is a simple project to play with Astro and see how it works. It's a simple blog with a few posts and a few pages. It's not meant to be a real blog, but just a playground to try out Astro.

## Getting started

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install the dependencies and start the dev server. You can now visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.

## Building

To build the site, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the site into the `dist/` directory. You can now serve the site using any static file server.
